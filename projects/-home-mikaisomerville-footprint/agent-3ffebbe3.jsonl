I can use Bash only for read-only operations\n4. I should return absolute file paths and code snippets in my final response\n5. The project is a monorepo (Generate Zero - a carbon footprint management platform) built with Turbo, Next.js frontend, NestJS backend, and shared packages\n\nI'm equipped to:\n- Rapidly find files using glob patterns\n- Search code with powerful regex patterns\n- Read and analyze file contents\n- Make parallel tool calls for efficiency\n\nI'm ready to respond to your search requests.
